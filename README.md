# Development Environment Tools and Related Info

This document serves as a reminder of tools, processes and other information that is useful for development.


## Node, Javascript and Web Development

  * [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) TypeScript execution and REPL for node.js, with source map support. Nice for doing TS wherever you want.
  * [Parcel JS](https://parceljs.org/): Parcel is an easy to use bundler that allows you to build web related features using a local hotloading web server. Think of this as having similarites with `create-react`, but can be used for anything (including React). Nice and simple if you want something simpler than `Webpack`.


## API Endpoints
 
   * [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) a set of endpoints that respond with specific JSON data.
   * [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a database as a service that allows you to quickly create and use a DB that you can dev against and/or take into produciton. Can be useful when you want to move fast and not yet manage your own DB etc.

## Docker
